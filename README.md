# Comparative Analysis of ROS1 and ROS2: Performance, Architecture and Application in Modern Robotics

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis between ROS1 and ROS2 while migrating the ViroFighter robot software stack from ROS1 Melodic to ROS2 Humble. The research focuses on architectural differences, performance metrics, and practical migration challenges in modern robotic systems.

### Project Objectives
1. **To compare the architectural differences** between ROS1 and ROS2, including communication layers, middleware, and real-time support
2. **To evaluate the scalability, security, and network communication improvements** of ROS2 over ROS1
3. **To analyze the ease of migration** from ROS1 to ROS2, identifying compatibility challenges and potential solutions
4. **To provide a detailed comparison report** highlighting key differences in performance, scalability, and real-time capabilities
5. **To establish guidelines and best practices** for migrating from ROS1 to ROS2 for different robotic platforms

### In-Scope Deliverables
- Complete ROS1 architecture analysis and documentation
- All custom ROS1 packages ported to ROS2
- ROS2 replacements for third-party packages identified and integrated
- Python-based ROS2 launch system implementation
- Full system integration and performance testing
- Utilizing the ros1_bridge for a phased and incremental migration.

### Documentation
- [**Architecture Documentation**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design and components
- [**Migration Guide**](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) - Step-by-step migration process
